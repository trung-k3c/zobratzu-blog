          This space does not belong to a person.  
          There is no author to follow, no name to remember.  
          What you see here is not a brand, but a breath —  
          a pause between becoming and returning.
        </p>
        <p>
          Zobra Tzu is not someone, but something unfolding.  
          Like mist before sunrise, or the shadow of a leaf.  
          There are no teachings here, only the trace of truth  
          as it quietly walks through an ordinary day.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are here, maybe you too have come back —  
          to a place you never left.
        </p>
